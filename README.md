# What-is-the-astrological-significance-of-ruby-gemstone-in-bringing-positive-life-changes-

In Vedic astrology, ruby is associated with the Sun, the planet of vitality, confidence, and authority. The Sun represents oneâ€™s soul, ego, and life force, and wearing ruby can strengthen these aspects, bringing significant positive changes. It is recommended for individuals whose Sun is weak or afflicted in their birth chart, as it helps remove obstacles and brings clarity, success, and personal power. Ruby is also believed to protect the wearer from negative energies, evil eye, and harmful planetary influences. It promotes inner strength, ambition, and leadership qualities, making it ideal for politicians, entrepreneurs, and people in leadership roles. On a personal level, it improves relationships by encouraging honesty, trust, and understanding. By energizing the root chakra, ruby stabilizes emotions and builds resilience in facing life challenges. Its fiery energy helps in overcoming fears and embracing change confidently, making it a gemstone of transformation.
